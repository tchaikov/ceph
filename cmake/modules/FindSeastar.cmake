# - Try to find Seastar
#
# Seastar has a lot of required cflags and ldflags, so a seastar.pc file
# is required for pkg-config.
#
# The Seastar build process generates a seastar.pc in two directories:
#   ${SEASTAR_ROOT}/build/release
#   ${SEASTAR_ROOT}/build/debug
#
# To select one, use the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable:
#   PKG_CONFIG_PATH=~/seastar/build/release cmake ..
#
# Once done this will define
#  SEASTAR_FOUND - System has Seastar
#  SEASTAR_COMPILE_OPTIONS - Compiler options required for using Seastar
#  SEASTAR_INCLUDE_DIRS - The Seastar include directories
#  SEASTAR_LIBRARIES - The libraries needed to use Seastar
#
# A Seastar::Seastar interface library target
#
